Movie Manager application

Movie Manager application that keeps track of movies in a collection. 

The application allows the user to:
- Add a new movie
- Delete an existing movie
- View a summary of all movies in the collection
- Search for movies (by title, genre, or rating)

The data is stored on the filesystem in a JSON file so the collection is maintained even when the application is not running.
